## Signpost Language
### Topic sentence
LED lighting ==is becoming increasingly popular due to== its high levels of energy efficiency.

### 过渡
**递进**
==Although== the effects of electrostatic energy ==in the above industries== can be serious
and sometimes life threatening, the consequences of unexpected ESDs can be
==even more ==serious in industries using flammable or explosive materials.

**多点平行**
==There are some issues related to ==the use of LED lighting, but most of these can be overcome. 
==One issue with== introduction of LED lighting systems is that...
==A second issue is that==...
According to [4], a final issue is that, when ..., ...

==When a fault== in an OHPL develops, addressing it involves several challenges. 
==The first step is to== locate the damaged line.
==Once the line has been located,== ==the next challenge== is to repair it.

### Concluding sentence
==In conclusion,== with life threatening consequences such as these, as well as the other damage that can be caused ==in the space, medical, IC, and other industries,== it is not surprising that millions of pounds are spent annually attempting to reduce ESC generation and avoid ESDs [7].

In conclusion, ==OHPLs play a key role in== keeping the electricity generated by power plants flowing to where it is needed. Damage to OHPLs caused by the weather, wildlife or human activity can lead to interruptions in the power supply, which, in turn, can cause economic damage. However, with the use of appropriate technology and safety equipment, engineers can normally locate and repair any failed lines extremely quickly. ==Therefore, OHPLs will probably continue to== be a main method of high voltage electricity transmission for many years to come.

==With all these benefits==, it is not surprising that use of LED lighting is being strongly encouraged by many governments [9].

## 范文分析
### Mock
Maglev trains ==are a fast, low-energy alternative== to traditional types of transport. 
定义开头，引入对象+特点
Maglev trains use electromagnets to float above guideways [1, 2]. 
==Those electromagnets== also create the forces that make the Maglevs move, speed up and slow down [1, 3]. ==This means== the trains move without touching the guideways, so there is no friction between the trains and the guideways [3, 4]. ==Due to this,== Maglevs use less energy than other forms of transport such as cars, planes, or other types of train [1]. 
工作原理——因果链（磁力-无接触-低能耗）——优点 1、2、3（比较突出）
==They can also== travel at speeds of up to 500 km/h, which is faster than cars, trains with wheels, and even as fast as some planes [3]. ==Not only can they move at high speed, but they can also== accelerate and decelerate very rapidly [1, 4]. Their high speed and acceleration mean that journey times are significantly faster than traveling by car [1], and similar to traveling by plane [1].
One drawback of ==those high speeds== is that if an accident occurs, the likelihood of passengers being seriously injured or killed is quite high [5]. However, that is a disadvantage of any high-speed vehicle, including planes, traditional high-speed trains, and fast cars. 
顺承**两面性特点**（高速）引出缺点，但可接受
==Similarly,== just like any highspeed vehicle, the noise from air friction becomes quite loud when Maglevs are traveling fast [1, 3]. ==However, this occurs only when ==they are moving faster than 200 km/h [3]. When they move more slowly than that, they are almost silent [3].


==Although expensive to build,== Maglev systems cost less over the long-term and can offer economic and environmental benefits to regions. 
主题句概览第二段内容，让步引导第二个缺点
Constructing a Maglev system is usually more expensive than building other types of transport system [1-3]. Each kilometer of a Maglev system can cost approximately US$20 million to construct [1]. However, over the long-term, operators of Maglev systems save large amounts of money because they are much cheaper to maintain than other transport systems [1, 3]. ==This is not only because of== the lack of contact between the Maglevs and the guideways [2, 4]==, but also because== they do not have the moving components which other types of vehicles have [1, 3]. 
展开阐述（举例说明+转折+因果解释）
Companies using the trains ==can also save money because it will ==be cheaper for them to transport their products [4]. 承接价格提到货运
==For the== local environment, Maglevs offer many benefits. 
对环境：自然环境（污染、噪声）+
They are powered by electricity, so do not emit any fumes or CO2 [2, 4]. 
The small amount of noise they produce means local areas suffer less from noise pollution [2, 4]. 
缺点三：逐步因果（位置-风险）
They are also built on raised guideways, which means the land below them can be used by animals or farmers [3], ==although if== an accident occurs, there is a danger that broken pieces of train or guideway could fall onto them [5]. 
总结：整体评估（比较，好）-让步：虽有缺点，但可接受 
(paraphrase 关键点：能源、快、高成本、运维低、经济效益、有利当地)
==In summary,== Maglev trains provide an efficient and fast transport system ==which is superior in many ways to other== rail, road or air-based systems. ==Although== constructing Maglev systems requires significant investment, the long-term environmental and economic benefits they offer make such investment worthwhile for both Maglev operators and local communities.

整体评价：
本文两个段落并没有明确的逻辑区分，说明分段标准可以只是字数均匀，行文连贯流畅即可
环境部分引出有些突兀，说明关键信息间不必非要存在承上启下，构思大纲时不必过于严苛

With ==the current proliferation== of electric vehicles (EVs), which ==has surged to approximately 5 million units== [1], the vehicle-to-grid (V 2 G) system has emerged as a ==pivotal technological advancement== aimed at optimizing energy structures. This innovative network ==facilitates the connection of== EVs to the grid, ==harnessing their energy storage capabilities to aid in both ==the storage and discharge of electrical power [1-5]. The batteries ==embedded within== these electric vehicles ==are instrumental in alleviating the discrepancies between== power generation and consumption within the electrical grid [1, 3, 4]. This capacity is particularly evident during fluctuations in power demand, ==characterized by peaks and troughs==, ==as== EVs can be charged during periods of low demand and discharged during periods of high demand [3, 4]. Furthermore, ==in the face of extreme weather events,== V 2 G systems ==provide an additional layer of resilience to== critical power networks [1, 2]==, thereby stabilizing energy supply.== Moreover, these advanced electricity storage systems ==enable the conservation of surplus renewable energy== generated from variable ==natural sources,== such as wind and solar power, thereby allowing for the optimization of these sustainable resources [2-4]. Consequently, the reliance on conventional electricity generation methods, ==predominantly fueled by== fossil fuels, can ==be diminished==, leading to ==a reduction in== carbon dioxide emissions [1, 2, 4].

In addition to their environmental benefits, V 2 G systems ==also exert a notable influence on== vehicle owners. While ==the initial investment== required for the installation of V 2 G charge-discharge equipment ==is borne by== the owners [1], ==it is anticipated that== both energy expenditures and operational costs will decrease over the long term. This reduction ==is facilitated by the integration== of solar panels, which can serve as an alternative energy source, thereby ==enhancing consumers' energy autonomy== [2, 5]. However, it is important to note that ==the frequent cycling of charge and discharge== may accelerate the degradation of battery life ==due to ==wear and tear [2-4], thereby increasing ==the financial burden associated with== battery replacement [2]. Additionally, the ==inherent unpredictability ==of the system's charging states may lead to variations in network load and available standby power [4]. Nevertheless, the average usage patterns of major vehicles can mitigate sporadic fluctuations, thereby ensuring a more reliable access to the charging and discharging capacity [4, 5]. In conclusion, vehicle-to-grid systems ==are poised to play a critical role== in the modern electrical grid. ==Despite the initial costs ==associated with installation and ==the potential for== battery degradation, ==the overarching benefits—both economic and environmentally sustainable—outweigh these challenges, underscoring the significance of V 2 G technology in contemporary energy management.==  [426]
