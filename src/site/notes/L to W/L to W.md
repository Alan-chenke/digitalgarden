### Transcript 
~~Okay, so welcome to our second lecture on e-vehicles, that's electric vehicles... you know... electric cars... electric vans... electric buses. In the last lecture, we looked at the design of e-vehicles, how they actually work, the challenges designers face, and why many of the big vehicle manufacturers – like Ford, Toyota – are investing in designing and producing e-vehicles. If you missed that lecture, make sure you view the video as soon as possible on Moodle. ~~

Right, so, what’s today’s focus? Well, today we’re going to discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of electric vehicles becoming the dominant form of vehicle on the roads. 
Now, the first claim that’s usually made about e-vehicles is that they’re “cleaner”... you know?... they’re better for the environment. Well, is that true? Yes and no. As you know, all e-vehicles use batteries that need to be charged. And how do they get charged? Well, they get charged by being connected to the main power grid. Now, unfortunately, at the moment, in most countries, a lot of the electricity in the power grid comes from coal or fossil fuel power plants. So, if all the drivers in a certain country all switch to using e-vehicles, then a lot more power will be needed from the main grid. And what does that mean? Well, it means more coal and fossil fuels will get burnt, and, yes, that’s right, more carbon dioxide will be produced... CO 2 emissions will jump up. Of course, in the future, when more countries are using solar power... wind power... hydroelectric power... the electricity used to charge the e-vehicle batteries will be much much cleaner... much better for the environment. But, until then the more that e-vehicles are used, the more that CO 2 emissions will increase. 

So, now, what else about e-vehicles? Well, there are concerns that long journeys are going to be a problem. Why is this a concern? Well, most countries have a very good infrastructure for refuelling normal petrol and diesel vehicles. Unfortunately, that isn't true for e-vehicle recharge stations. No. At the moment, recharge infrastructure is very limited in most countries. That means people buying e-cars... e-vehicles... at the moment, well, they have to be very careful where they drive because it's not that easy to find a place to recharge their vehicle. Now, maybe you could just carry a couple of spare batteries, right? Well, no, that’s not possible with e-vehicles – the batteries they contain cannot be taken in and out easily, so if the battery runs out of power, it's not that easy to simply put a new battery in. Even if it was, few people could afford the price of having a spare battery – they’re actually one of the most expensive components of e-vehicles. In the future, though, once solar panel technology for e-vehicles becomes more efficient, this won’t be such a big problem. Those future e-vehicles should be able to charge themselves constantly – only in daylight, obviously, but even if it’s cloudy, they’ll still be able to harness some of the power from the daylight coming through the clouds. 

Now, talking about recharging, another issue with recharging the cars is queues. What do I mean? Well... well... do any of you drive? Oh, lots of you. OK. Well, you’ll know then, that when you fill up your car with petrol, or diesel, you’re usually at the petrol station for about 10 minutes, right? Well, that’s not going to be the case with e-vehicles, not at the moment anyway. Of course, it depends on the power of the charger and on the power of the vehicle’s charging system, but charging a vehicle to 80% of the car battery’s capacity can take anything from 20 minutes to 2 hours. And 20 minutes is only for the really expensive cars! Now, if every customer is taking between 20 minutes and 2 hours to charge their cars, there are going to be big queues at the recharge stations, right? Now, of course, you could get your car to drive to the recharge station and fill itself up. But that's something different – that's a self-driving vehicle, which is different from an e-vehicle. A self-driving vehicle might be packed with lots of electronic equipment, but it can still have a petrol or diesel engine, so it’s a different thing. 

Right, we’re running short of time. So, a final aspect I’d like to talk about is noise. So, if you’ve seen an e-vehicle driving, you’ll know it produces almost no noise. So, much less noise than traditional diesel or petrol vehicles. This is actually beneficial because if e-vehicles become dominant, there’ll be much less noise pollution. So, cities and towns will become quieter, the homes of people living close to main roads will all be quieter, and that's believed to be very good for people’s psychological health, especially children. Of course, it’s also beneficial to all the local wildlife – birds, small animals, etc. There is a disadvantage to this, though. Have you heard about it? No? Well, sadly, there have already been accidents... people being hit by e-vehicles... because they didn’t hear them coming. When most people cross roads, they don’t just look, they also listen for cars coming. With the lack of noise, people may be taken by surprise because they have the old habits of listening before they cross the road, especially near corners where they can’t see what’s coming. They wouldn’t hear an e-vehicle coming and so they might get hit. So, quiet cars are actually quite dangerous. 

Alright, to sum up. At the moment, there are still many issues with e-vehicles – the pollution they cause, the problems with long journeys and charge times – but in a few years’ time, once solar technology, wind technology, etc is fully developed, many of these problems will be fixed, and e-vehicles should be able to fulfil their potential of being a much more environmentally friendly and efficient form of road transport than petrol and diesel vehicles. OK, that’s it. See you at the tutorial. And if you’re driving home today, drive safely! [990 words]


### 答案范例
==At present==, there are ==several problems== with ==e-vehicles==, but in the ==future== many of these should be solved. 
<span style="background:#ff4d4f">主题句：引出主题词+呼应 TA</span>

==The first issue== is that e-vehicles are not as environmentally friendly as is often believed. E-vehicles are ==usually== charged using power from the main grid. Most of this power is still generated via coal or fossil fuel power plants. ==Therefore==, each time an e-vehicle is charged, CO2 is produced. ==However, in the future==, once more power is produced using renewable energy sources, ==this should be== less of a problem. 

==The second issue== is connected to long journeys. ==At the moment==, there are not that many recharging stations for e-vehicles, ==so== drivers have to consider carefully where they drive to. Spare batteries are very expensive and very difficult to fit, ==so== carrying a spare battery is not usually an option. ==However,== once solar charging has been developed for e-vehicles, this ==should no longer be== a serious issue. 

==The third issue== is related to queues at recharge stations. ==Since== most e-vehicles take a long time to charge, waiting times at recharge stations will be long. 
（录音没提，所以没有 future）

==The final issue== concerns how quiet e-vehicles are. They are quiet ==because== they do not have a petrol or diesel engine that produces noise. This can cause accidents ==because== when people are crossing the road, they will not hear the vehicles coming. ==However==, a benefit of this lack of noise is that the vehicles will reduce levels of noise pollution, which can improve psychological health.

### 主观评价：
清晰但有喷麦现象，难度相较上学期没什么提升，
词汇难度也不大，看得出来主要考察的还是写作

### 高级表达
==Currently,== electric vehicles (EVs) ==face== several challenges; however, ==it is anticipated that== many of these issues will be addressed in the future. 
The ==foremost concern== ==pertains to== the environmental impact of EVs, which is often overstated. Typically, the electricity used to charge these vehicles ==is sourced from== the main power grid, ==a significant portion== of which ==is still derived from== coal and fossil fuel power plants. ==Consequently==, each charging event ==contributes to== carbon dioxide emissions. ==Nevertheless==, with the anticipated increase in energy generation from renewable sources, this particular issue ==is expected to diminish== over time.

A second challenge ==is associated with== long-distance travel. ==Presently==, the infrastructure for EV charging ==is limited==, ==necessitating== careful planning by drivers regarding their routes. Furthermore, the high cost and complexity of carrying spare batteries ==render this option impractical== for most users. However, advancements in solar charging technology for EVs are likely to mitigate this concern in the future.

The third issue relates to the extended waiting times at charging stations. ==Given that ==the majority of EVs require significant time to recharge, queues at these facilities can be ==substantial==, leading to inconvenience for users.

Lastly, the ==inherent quietness of== electric vehicles presents a dual challenge. While the absence of an internal combustion engine results in reduced noise pollution, which can positively influence psychological well-being, it ==simultaneously poses a safety risk.== ==Pedestrians== may be unable to hear approaching EVs, ==increasing the likelihood of== accidents.

In conclusion, although ==the current reliance on== non-renewable energy sources and the challenges associated with charging infrastructure ==present hurdles for== electric vehicles, ==the future holds promise with== technological advancements, such as solar power, that are likely to ==alleviate these issues==.
